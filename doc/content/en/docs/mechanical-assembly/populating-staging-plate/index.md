  Mounting components to the staging plate 
---

We now have the main structure of the machine assembled! Now we'll mount some components to the bottom of the staging plate.

## Overview

Refer to the image below for referencing where to mount parts on the staging plate.

## Soldering Pump

Some LumenPnP kits shipped with a pump that had its connector pre-soldered to it. If your pump is not pre-soldered, follow along here to prepare your pump.

1. Gather your Pump, the pump wire, and two lengths of heatshrink.

2. Slip the heatshrink over the two exposed leads of the wire.

3. Wrap the red wire around the left lead as shown in the image below. Wrap the black wire around the right lead.

4. Solder both wires to the pump leads. The polarity does not matter.

5. Slip the heat shrink over the solder joints and motor lead. Use a hot air gun, lighter, or other heat source to shrink the heatshrink.

## Pump mount

The first thing we'll mount to the staging plate is the Pump Mount (FDM-0025). This print suspends the pump using a couple rubber bands to ensure none of the vibration of the pump is transferred into the frame.

1. Start by press-fitting M3 nuts into the recesses in the pump mount.

2. Now we'll mount the pump in the print using a couple rubber bands. Start by grabbing the rubber band with both hands, giving it a half twist, and folding it over on itself, making two loops.

3. Now stretch each rubber band over each pair of pegs on the mount. Guide the pump between each pair of bands so that it's suspended in the print.

4. Mount it to the staging plate using two M3 x 10mm screws in the location shown below.

## Valve mount

Now we'll attach the Valve Mount (FDM-0042) to the staging plate.

1. Press fit M3 nuts into the recesses in the valve mount.

2. Now we'll mount the valve to the print. Use two M3x8mm bolts to attach the valve to the mount as shown below. Mount it to the staging plate using four M3x8mm screws in the location shown below.

## Pneumatic Y splitter mount

1. This one is easy! We'll just mount the pneumatic Y splitter to the staging plate using an M3x30mm bolt and an M3 nut. You can find the correct location and orientation to mount it below:

## Bottom camera mount

1. Stack the Up Light Mount (FDM-0019), the Bottom Ring Light, and the Up Camera Mount (FDM-0020) together.

2. Attach them to the staging plate using four M3x30mm screws and four M3 nuts.

3. Loosen the screw on the camera so that we can adjust the camera's focus later. Even after doing so, it still might be difficult to rotate the lens. A light grip with some pliers and a gentle twist can help break the lens free and make it easier to rotate by hand. Mount the camera into the up camera mount using four M2.5x8mm screws by tapping directly into the plastic. Match the orientation to the image below:

## Nozzle Holder

1. Grab the Nozzle Holder (FDM-0024) and slide three M3 nuts into the slots in the back of the print.

2. Using three M3x8mm machine screws, tighten it onto the staging plate as shown below.
