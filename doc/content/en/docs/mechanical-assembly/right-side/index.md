## Assembly

9. Take the Right Back Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the hole into which it is inserted (See Left Side Assembly Step 1 for an example).
10. If using slot nuts which must be inserted from the end of the extrusion, take the assembly and turn it so that you are looking directly at the ends of the v-slot opposite the attached Right Back Leg. Otherwise, continue to step three and note if a step says you must insert slot nuts.

* Insert two slot nuts into the top slot of the top rail (label A) from the open end.
  {{< container-image path="images/slot_nut_a.png" alt="Two slots nuts are inserted into the top slot of the top rail" >}}
* Insert two slot nuts into the top slot on the bottom rail (label E) from the open end. Note: These will be used later when joining the two side assemblies.

* Insert three slot nuts into the right slot of the bottom rail (label F) from the open end.

* Insert one slot nut into the left slot on the bottom rail (label H) from the open end.

11. Take the Right Front Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Right Back Leg.

12. On the top rail, position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut. If using slot nuts which can be inserted into the slot, you will need to insert two nuts during this step.

13. On the bottom rail, the outer side has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it. If using slot nuts which can be inserted into the slot, you will need to insert three nuts during this step.

14. On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the back leg. Position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it. If using slot nuts which can be inserted into the slot, you will need to insert one nut during this step.
