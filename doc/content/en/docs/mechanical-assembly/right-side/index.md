Great! Now lets make the right side. Very similar to the left, just a couple small changes.

## Belt Tension Arm

| 1   | M3 Cap Nut                  |
| 1   | M5x25 machine screw         |
| 1   | M5 Nyloc Hex Nut            |
| 1   | M5x40 machine screw         |
| 1   | M5 Hex Nut                  |

{{< container-image path="images/IMG_20210826_150501-web.jpg" alt="Belt Tension Arm Parts" >}}

1. Insert an M3 Hex Nut into its slot on the back of a {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_20210826_150533-web.jpg" alt="Inserted M3 Hex Nut" >}}

2. Insert the M3x16mm Machine Screw through the front hole in the {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}} and then tighten.

3. Thread an M3 Cap Nut on the end of the M3x16mm Machine Screw.

4. Insert the M5x25mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top of the {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}} so that it passes through a GT2 Pulley Idler. **Note** that the screw orientation should match the image below, opposite from the last step.

5. Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}} and tighten. Make sure the idler can still spin freely.

6. Insert the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the  {{<tooltip "Front Right Leg" "FDM-0002">}}.
    {{< container-image path="images/Right-Side-Step-6.png" alt="M5 Nyloc Hed Nut positioned in Front Left Leg" >}}

7. Insert completed {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}} assembly between the arms on the {{<tooltip "Front Right Leg" "FDM-0002">}}, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up.

8. Insert the M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}} and tighten into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut. Do not over-tighten, and ensure you can still pivot the tension arm.

## Assembly

| Qty | Part                          |
|----:|-------------------------------|
| 1   | FDM-0002 (Front Right Leg)    |
| 1   | FDM-0004 (Back Right Leg)     |
| 2   | Aluminum extrusion            |
| 6   | M5 T-slot nut                 |
| 6   | M5x10 machine screw           |
| 1   | NEMA17 stepper motor          |
| 1   | GT2 Pulley (with grub screws) |
| 4   | M3x8 machine screw            |

9. Take the {{<tooltip "Front Right Leg" "FDM-0002">}} and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the holes in which they're inserted. If you have a hard time getting the extrusion into the slots, gently slide them into place using some taps from a mallet.

10. Take the {{<tooltip "Back Right Leg" "FDM-0004">}} and place it onto the two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the {{<tooltip "Front Right Leg" "FDM-0002">}}. Your progress should look like the image below.

11. On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.

  {{< container-image path="images/top_screws.png" alt="Location for the top screws" >}}

12. On the bottom rail, the outer side has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the {{<tooltip "Back Right Leg" "FDM-0004">}}, two on the {{<tooltip "Front Right Leg" "FDM-0002">}}). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

  {{< container-image path="images/outer_screws.png" alt="Location for screws on the outer side" >}}

13. On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the {{<tooltip "Back Right Leg" "FDM-0004">}}. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

  {{< container-image path="images/inner_screws.png" alt="Location for the inner screw" >}}

14. Slide the GT2 Pulley onto the the motor shaft of a NEMA17 stepper motor with the set screw side facing the motor body. Align the pulley so that the end is roughly flush with the end of motor shaft, then tighten one of the set screws on the pulley into the flat side of the motor shaft. Tighten the second set screw as well.

15. Mount the NEMA17 stepper motor to the {{<tooltip "Back Right Leg" "FDM-0004">}} with four M3x8mm screws, ensuring that the connector is facing inwards towards the zip tie loops as dictated in the picture.
