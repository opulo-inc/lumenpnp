4. Insert the M5x25mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top of the {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}} so that it passes through a GT2 Pulley Idler.

5. Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}} and tighten. Make sure the idler can still spin freely.

6. Insert the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the {{<tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001">}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/Left-Side-Step-6.png" alt="M5 Nyloc Hed Nut positioned in Front Left Leg" >}}

7. Insert completed {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm "FDM-0037>}} assembly between the arms on the {{<tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001">}}, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up.

8. Insert the M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the {{<tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037">}} and tightens into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut. Do not over-tighten, and ensure you can still pivot the tension arm.

## Assembly

| Qty | Part                               |
|----:|------------------------------------|

|   1 | GT2 Pulley (with grub screws)      |
|   6 | M3x8 machine screw                 |
|   1 | Limit switch PCB                   |
|   2 | M5x25 machine screw                |
|   1 | FDM-0007 (Frame Umbilical Mount)   |
|   1 | FDM-0046 (Umbilical Swivel Part 1) |
|   1 | FDM-0047 (Umbilical Swivel Part 2) |
|   1 | M5x40 machine screw                |

9. Take the {{<tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001">}} and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the holes in which they're inserted. If you have a hard time getting the extrusion into the slots, gently slide them into place using some taps from a mallet.

10. Take the {{<tooltip "Back Left Leg" "FDM-0003">}} and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the {{<tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001">}}. Your progress should look like the image below.

  {{< container-image path="images/Left-Side-Step-10-2.png" alt="Inserting the V-slot Extrusions into the Front Left Leg Result 2" >}}

11. On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.

  {{< container-image path="images/top_screws.png" alt="Top screws securing V-slot Extrusions" >}}

12. On the bottom rail, the outer side has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the {{<tooltip "Back Left Leg" "FDM-0003">}}, two on the {{<tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001">}}). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

  {{< container-image path="images/outer_screws.png" alt="All three screw locations for securing the V-slot Extrusions to the Front Left Leg and the Back Left Leg" >}}

13. On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the {{<tooltip "Back Left Leg" "FDM-0003">}}. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

  {{< container-image path="images/inner_screws.png" alt="Securing the Bottom V-slot Extrusion to the top of the Back Left Leg alternate view" >}}

14. Slide the GT2 Pulley onto the the motor shaft of a NEMA17 stepper motor with the set screw side facing the motor body. Align the pulley so that the end is roughly flush with the end of motor shaft, then tighten one of the set screws on the pulley into the flat side of the motor shaft. Tighten the second set screw as well.

15. Mount the NEMA17 stepper motor to the {{<tooltip "Back Left Leg" "FDM-0003">}}. Attach it using four M3x8mm screws, ensuring that the connector is facing inwards towards the zip tie loops as dictated in the picture.

  {{< container-image path="images/Left-Side-Step-15-2-MANUAL.png" alt="Orienting Left Y-axis NEMA17 stepper motor with the connector facing inwards" >}}

16. Mount one of the three limit switches to the {{<tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001">}} as shown in the image. Use two M3x8mm screws and tap them directly into the print.
    {{< container-image path="images/Left-Side-Step-16.png" alt="Attaching the Y-axis limit switch" >}}

17. Next, we'll mount the {{<tooltip "Frame Umbilical Mount" "FDM-0007">}}. Using two M5x25mm screws, attach it to the {{<tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001">}} as shown, threading directly into the part.

18. Lastly, we'll assemble the umbilical swivel. {{<tooltip "Swivel Part 1 and Swivel Part 2" "FDM-0046 and FDM-0047">}} fit together as shown below, and are secured in place with a M5x40mm screw and an M5 nut. Tighten so there's no play in the fit, but the two parts can swivel easily. This part helps keep the X gantry umbilical suspended over the build area. Set it aside for now.
