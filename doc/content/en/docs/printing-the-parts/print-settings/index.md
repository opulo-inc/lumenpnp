During development of the Index, all parts were printed in PLA. A few parts in particular require quite a high strength if being printed. Of course, every printer runs a bit different, and these are just guidelines to illustrate the necessary strength difference between different parts.

#### Default Settings
- 3 shells
- 20% infill
- 5 Top/Bottom layers

#### Gantry Part Settings
- 4 shells
- 30% infill
